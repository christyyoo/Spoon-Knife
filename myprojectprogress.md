Currently, the project that has the greatest appeal to me is Magenta, a project based on TensorFlow to creating art and music. I have very little experience working with TensorFlow, but would like to research more about it! As for organization, it really depends on how I'll be working on the project. If I am working with other people, it would be a nice idea to use a blessed repository to keep workflow organized.
